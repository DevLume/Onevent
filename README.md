# Onevent

This is going to be a ticket distribution site. The Onevent is suppose to gather most of the lithuanian ticket distributors to one easy-to-use and user-friendly metabase. Yet, it is still in development with barely a single feature implemented. If you're still here reading this, be our guest and enjoy our code.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Things you need to get the project on your system:
* any Git GUI (like Git Bash, SourceTree, etc.)
* Microsoft® Visual Studio® 2017
* Microsoft® SQL Server® 2012 Express

### Installing

You may ask how to get a development env running?

Firstly, clone the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/deprocrastinator/Onevent.git
```

Open the project on Visual Studio. Then go to Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Manager Console. In the console run a command:

```

```

After the reinstallation finishes, simply run the project by pressing green play button.
Now you should be good to go. The sandbox is yours to play around.
